## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

First of all I read all documents for this project.  
Than make analyse of the layout and initial the best method to approach.
Of course I use some similar exercise (I had learned) to compare the layout and structure.
After some try and errors, I figure it out.

I made notes on my codes

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I started with 1 column first and after I got the same layout, I applied them on the rest of the design. 
It helps me to have a better visual as I add bright backgrount-colors to each steps.
I also combine items as they have same layout, that will reduce line of codes. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.card-content-orange, .card-content-darkcyan, .card-content-verydarkcyan{
    box-sizing: border-box;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    width:18rem;
    height: 45%;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: flex-start;
    padding: 2rem;
    /* background-color: hsl(252, 81%, 36%); *for visual**/
}


### Continued development

I use VS code as editor and after I finished my project I updated my code to Github. I also make a live site url. Unfortunately the image 'icon of cars' is not appearing (see last one screenshot). 
I try serveal times to fix this by asking questions to chatGPT and search online. 
I just have to wait for my mentor to give me proper advis how to fix this.
